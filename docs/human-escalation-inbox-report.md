## 3. Database Changes

### Migration 1732000000000
- Created `conversation_ownership` enum: `ai_active`, `human_pending`, `human_active`, `returned_to_ai`
- Added columns to `conversations`: `ownership_status` (default `ai_active`), `human_owner_id` (FK to `staff_profiles.user_id`), `escalated_at`, `assigned_at`
- Created indexes on `ownership_status` and `human_owner_id`

### Migration 1733000000000
- Added `closed` to `conversation_ownership` enum

### Migration 1734000000000
- Added `first_response_at` (timestamptz) to `escalations`
- Added `returned_to_ai_count` (integer, default 0) to `escalations`

## 4. Routes Added

### Business-Aware Role Mapping

The escalation detector understands business-specific role terminology:

| Business Type | Roles |
|--------------|-------|
| Clinics | doctor, specialist, consultant |
| Salons | stylist, beautician, manager |
| Gyms | trainer, coach |
| General | owner, representative, support, staff, team member |

### Distinction Rules

The classifier distinguishes:
- **ESCALATE**: "Can I speak to [role]", "I want to talk to someone", "Connect me with [role]"
- **DO NOT ESCALATE**: "What are [role]'s timings?", "Who performs this treatment?", "Do you have [role] available?"
- **Confidence threshold**: 0.7 (configurable)
- **Fallback**: If the LLM call fails, no escalation is triggered (safe default)

```

### State Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| `ai_active` | `human_pending` | Escalation detected by LLM classifier or agent |
| `human_pending` | `human_active` | Staff clicks "Join Conversation" |
| `human_active` | `ai_active` | Staff clicks "Return to AI" |
| Any | `closed` | Conversation resolved |

### State Tracking

Each conversation tracks:
- `ownership_status` — current state
- `human_owner_id` — staff who joined (nullable)
- `escalated_at` — when escalation occurred
- `assigned_at` — when staff joined
- `updated_at` — last state change

## 7. Notification Architecture

### Escalation Notifications
- **Type**: `escalation_required`
- **Trigger**: Escalation detected by classifier or agent
- **Content**: Customer name, conversation link
- **Display**: Notification bell badge, sidebar inbox badge

### Reminder Notifications
- **Type**: `escalation_reminder_5min`, `escalation_reminder_15min`, `escalation_reminder_30min`
- **Schedule**: Background check every 60 seconds
- **Deduplication**: Checks for existing notifications before creating
- **No duplicates**: One notification per threshold per conversation
- **Destinations**: Dashboard only — no email, no WhatsApp

### Notification Drawer Display
- Escalation notifications show a "→ View in Inbox" link
- Type-specific icons and colors
- Time-ago display

## 8. Security Verification

### Middleware Chain
All inbox routes pass through: `authenticate` → `loadMembership` → `requireStaff` → `requireBusinessAccess`

### Tenant Isolation
- Every controller method reads `businessId` from `req.membership!` (never from user input)
- Every repository SQL query includes `business_id = $1` in WHERE clauses
- Messages are protected by conversation-level business_id checks
- Founder (SUPER_ADMIN) access is preserved through middleware bypass

### Cross-Tenant Leakage
- **None detected** for inbox endpoints
- The `addMessage` method uses a subquery to auto-resolve `business_id` from the conversation
- Upstream `findById` with `businessId` check prevents unauthorized conversation access

**Rating**: TENANT SAFE

## 9. Mobile Verification

### Responsive Design
| Feature | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Inbox cards | `flex-col` on mobile, `sm:flex-row` on desktop | ✅ |
| Workspace layout | `flex-col` on mobile, `lg:flex-row` on desktop | ✅ |
| Info sidebar | Full width on mobile, fixed 18rem on desktop | ✅ |
| Message bubbles | 85% width on mobile, 75% on desktop | ✅ |
| Filters | Wrapping flex container, responsive inputs | ✅ |
| Tabs | Horizontal scroll when overflow | ✅ |
| Navigation | Sheet-based mobile sidebar drawer | ✅ |
| Desktop sidebar | Hidden on mobile via `hidden md:flex` | ✅ |
| Tables | None — all card-based | ✅ |

**Rating**: MOBILE READY

## 10. End-to-End Validation Results

### Test A: "Can I speak to the doctor?"
- **Expected**: Escalation created → human_pending
- **Path**: Escalation detector LLM classifies as escalation → escalation created → ownership set to human_pending → hold message sent
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test B: "I want to talk to someone."
- **Expected**: Escalation created
- **Path**: Same as Test A
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test C: "Can someone from the team call me?"
- **Expected**: Escalation created
- **Path**: LLM classifies callback request as escalation
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test D: "What are the doctor's timings?"
- **Expected**: No escalation, normal response
- **Path**: LLM classifies as informational → no escalation → agent processes normally
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test E: "Who performs the treatment?"
- **Expected**: No escalation, normal response
- **Path**: Same as Test D
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test F: "Do you have specialists available?"
- **Expected**: No escalation, normal response
- **Path**: Same as Test D
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (code path)

### Test G: Web Chat escalation → human joins → human replies → return to AI
- **Path**: Escalation detected → human_pending → Join (POST /inbox/conversations/:id/join) → human_active → send message (POST /inbox/conversations/:id/message) → Return (POST /inbox/conversations/:id/return-to-ai) → ai_active
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (all endpoints tested)

### Test H: WhatsApp escalation → human joins → human replies → return to AI
- **Path**: Same as Test G, but delivery goes through WhatsApp channel adapter
- **Result**: ✅ Verified (delivery service handles both web_chat and whatsapp)

### Test I: Business A escalation never appears in Business B
- **Path**: Every query filters by `business_id = $1` sourced from `req.membership!.businessId`
- **Result**: ✅ Tenant isolation confirmed

**Note**: Tests A-F require actual LLM inference for the escalation detector. Code paths are verified. The specific LLM behavior (whether it correctly classifies each phrase) should be validated with real test messages against the deployed system.

## 11. Escalation Metrics

### Tracked Data

| Metric | Source | Query |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total escalations created | `escalations` table | `COUNT(*)` |
| Resolved escalations | `escalations.status = 'resolved'` | `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'resolved')` |
| Unresolved escalations | `escalations.status = 'pending'` | `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'pending')` |
| Average first response time | `escalations.first_response_at - created_at` | `AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...))` |
| Average resolution time | `escalations.resolved_at - created_at` | `AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...))` |
| Returned-to-AI count | `escalations.returned_to_ai_count` | `SUM(returned_to_ai_count)` |

### Endpoint
`GET /api/inbox/metrics` — returns all metrics for the authenticated business, auth-gated.

## 12. Remaining Pilot Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **LLM classification accuracy** | Medium | The escalation detector uses a dedicated prompt with explicit business-aware role mapping. However, LLM behavior is probabilistic. Monitor false positives/negatives in production and adjust threshold or prompt as needed. |
| **Escalation reminder service persistence** | Low | The reminder service runs in-process (setInterval). If the backend restarts, reminders reset. Not a data loss — just a timing reset. For production, consider a persistent scheduler. |
| **addMessage businessId gap** | Low | The subquery correctly resolves the conversation's business_id. The upstream findById check provides additional defense. Low risk for current architecture. |
| **Super Admin slug/businessId validation** | Low | Founders can pass any businessId via query param. Intended behavior, but could be confusing if invalid IDs are passed. |
| **PWA offline capability** | Medium | Current PWA setup includes manifest and icons but no service worker. The app requires network connectivity. Consider adding a service worker for production. |
